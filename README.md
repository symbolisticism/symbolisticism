**I work to deliver expectations. Having a development and customer service background, I know what it means to communicate effectively
and be detail-oriented. While I am still relatively new to Flutter and Dart development, I bring my work ethic, organization, drive to learn and improve, and leadership qualities to the table wherever I go. I have worked on mobile app development, firmware, frontend web development, and databases.**
